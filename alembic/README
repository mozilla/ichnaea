The first time you use alembic, it will automatically create an
`alembic_version` table for you.

To update your schema to the latest version, just issue this command:

```
$ alembic upgrade head
```


To downgrade your database to a specific database version, you will need
the hash in ichnaea/alembic/versions.

Example ::

```
$ alembic downgrade 2a311d11a90d
```


Creating a new revision is done by issuing the `revision` command and
`-m` to pass in a comment.

```
alembic revision -m "your database revision comment here"
```

That will generate a script to do upgrades and downgrades of the
database.

Generating a DDL diff:

Executing `alembic upgrade head --sql` will generate all the DDL up to
the head for every version managed in alembic's history.

To get just the new DDL, you need to pass in two version numbers, or
you can run the script in alembic/generate_diff.sh.

When committing a new migration, it's handy to save the actual DDL
into a .sql file in alembic/versions to make it easier to review the
database upgrade change.


---

Stamping the database as 'current'.  If you generate the database
directly from the models, you can use `alembic stamp head` to just
force alembic to assume that everything is in sync.  Subsequent
database migrations will work correctly.
