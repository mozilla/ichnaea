<h2>Mozilla Privacy Policy (08 May 2013)</h2>

<p>
    We care about your privacy. When MozStumbler sends information to Mozilla
    (that’s us), our privacy policy describes how we handle that information.
</p>

<h3>Things you should know</h3>

<p>
    MozStumbler connects to us and others in order to provide updates and
    location services.
</p>

<p>
    The device you are using, like most mobile devices, is created by several
    parties. This notice only covers how Mozilla handles your information for
    official versions of MozStumbler and the Mozilla Location Service
    authorized by Mozilla.
</p>

<h3>Mozilla Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>
    Your privacy is an important factor that Mozilla (that’s us) considers in
    the development of each of our products and services. We are committed to
    being transparent and open and want you to know how we receive information
    about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.
</p>

<h3>What do we mean by "personal information?"</h3>

<p>
    For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you,
    like your name or email address. Any information that falls outside of
    this is "non-personal information." If we store your personal information
    with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as
    personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of
    data then the remaining is non-personal information.
</p>

<h3>How do we learn information about you?</h3>

<p>
    We learn information about you when:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash
        reports from Firefox);
    </li>
    <li>
        we collect it automatically through our products and services
        (e.g., when we check whether your version of Firefox is up to date);
    </li>
    <li>
        someone else tells us information about you (e.g., Thunderbird works
        with your email providers to set up your account); or
    </li>
    <li>
        when we try and understand more about you based on information
        you’ve given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize
        language for some of our services).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>What do we do with your information once we have it?</h3>

<p>
    When you give us personal information, we will use it in the ways for
    which you’ve given us permission. Generally, we use your information
    to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.
</p>

<h3>When do we share your information with others?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        When we have gotten your permission to share it.
    </li>
    <li>
        For processing or providing products and services to you, but only
        if those entities receiving your information are contractually
        obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla.
    </li>
    <li>
        When we are fulfilling our
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">
            mission of being open
        </a>.
        We sometimes release information to make our products better and
        foster an open web, but when we do so, we will remove your personal
        information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes
        the risk of you being re-identified.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive
        requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit.
        We’ll notify you when we’re asked to hand over your personal
        information in this way unless we’re legally prohibited from
        doing so. When we receive requests like this, we’ll only release
        your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the
        law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to
        limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a
        third party’s request to disclose your information.
    </li>
    <li>
        When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone
        else. We will only share your information in this way if we have
        a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect
        the rights, property or safety of you, our other users,
        Mozilla or the public.
    </li>
    <li>
        If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo
        a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your
        information to a successor or affiliate.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>How do we store and protect your personal information?</h3>

<p>
    We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have
    it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures.
    Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we’ll notify
    you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
    <br />
    We also don’t want your personal information for any longer than we
    need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it
    for. Once we don’t need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we
    are required by law to keep it longer.
</p>

<h3>What else do we want you know?</h3>

<p>
    We’re a global organization and our computers are in several different
    places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers
    may also be in various countries. This means that your information might
    end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country
    may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours.
    By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of
    your information. No matter what country your information is in,
    we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments
    we make in this privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
    If you are under 13, we don’t want your personal information, and you
    must not provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your
    child who is under 13 has provided us with personal information,
    please contact us to have your child’s information removed.
</p>

<h3>What if we change this policy?</h3>

<p>
    We may need to change this policy and when we do, we’ll notify you.
