    Compute the distance between a pair of lat/longs in meters using
    the haversine calculation.  The output distance is in kilometers.

    Error is up to 0.55%, which works out to 5m per 1km.  This is
    still better than what GPS provides so it should be 'good enough'.

    Accuracy: since the earth is not quite a sphere, there are small
    errors in using spherical geometry; the earth is actually roughly
    ellipsoidal (or more precisely, oblate spheroidal) with a radius
    varying between about 6,378km (equatorial) and 6,357km (polar),
    and local radius of curvature varying from 6,336km (equatorial
    meridian) to 6,399km (polar). 6,371 km is the generally accepted
    value for the Earth's mean radius. This means that errors from
    assuming spherical geometry might be up to 0.55% crossing the
    equator, though generally below 0.3%, depending on latitude and
    direction of travel. An accuracy of better than 3m in 1km is
    mostly good enough for me, but if you want greater accuracy, you
    could use the Vincenty formula for calculating geodesic distances
    on ellipsoids, which gives results accurate to within 1mm.
