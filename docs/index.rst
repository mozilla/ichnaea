===============

``Mozilla Ichnaea`` is an application to provide geo-location coordinates
from other sources of data (cell or WiFi networks, GeoIP, etc.).

Mozilla hosts an instance of this service, called the Mozilla Location
Service or MLS. More information about this specific service can be found
at https://wiki.mozilla.org/CloudServices/Location

You can interact with the service in two ways:

- either submit information about what you see around you, given a location.

- or search for your current location, given what you see around you.


About the name
==============

In Greek mythology, Ichnaea (Iknaia) means "the tracker".
