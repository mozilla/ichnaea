 Local development environment

This chapter covers getting started with Ichnaea using Docker for a local
development environment.

.. contents::


.. _localdev-quickstart:

Setup Quickstart
================

1. Install required software: Docker, docker-compose (1.10+), make, and git.

   **Linux**:

      Use your package manager.

   **OSX**:

      Install `Docker for Mac <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/>`_ which
      will install Docker and docker-compose.

      Use `homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_ to install make and git::

         $ brew install make git

   **Other**:

      Install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_.

      Install `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_. You need
      1.10 or higher.

      Install `make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_.

      Install `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_.

2. Clone the repository so you have a copy on your host machine.

   Instructions for cloning are `on the Ichnaea page in GitHub
   <https://github.com/mozilla/ichnaea>`_.

3. (*Optional/Advanced*) Set UID and GID for Docker container user.

   If you're on Linux, you will need to set the UID/GID of the app user that
   runs in the Docker containers to match your UID/GID.  Run::

       $ make my.env

   Then run ``id`` to get your UID/GID.  edit the file and set the
   ``ICHNAEA_UID`` and ``ICHNAEA_GID`` variables. These will get used when
   creating the app user in the base image.

   If you ever want different values, change them in ``my.env`` and re-run
   ``make build``.

4. Build Docker images for Ichnaea services.

   From the root of this repository, run::

       $ make build

   That will build the app Docker image required for development.

5. Initialize Redis and MySQL.

   Then you need to set up services. To do that, run::

       $ make runservices

   This starts service containers. Then run::

       $ make setup

   This creates the MySQL database and sets up tables and things.

   You can run ``make setup`` any time you want to wipe any data and start
   fresh.


At this point, you should have a basic functional Ichnaea development
environment that has no geo data in it.

To see what else you can do, run::

        $ make

.. _localdev-updating:

Updating the Dev Environment
============================

Updating code
-------------

Any time you want to update the code in the repostory, run something like this from
the main branch::

    $ git pull

The actual command depends on what you're working on and the state of your copy of
the repository.

After you have the latest code, you'll need to update other things.

If there were changes to the requirements files or setup scripts, you'll need to
build new images::

    $ make build

If there were changes to the database tables, you'll need to wipe the MySQL
database and Redis::

    $ make setup


.. _localdev-configuration:

Specifying configuration
========================

Configuration is pulled from these sources:

1. The ``my.env`` file.
2. ENV files located in ``/app/docker/config/``. See ``docker-compose.yml`` for
   which ENV files are used in which containers, and their precedence.
3. Configuration defaults defined in the code.

The sources above are ordered by precedence, i.e. configuration values defined
in the ``my.env`` file will override values in the ENV files or defaults.

The following ENV files can be found in ``/app/docker/config/``:

``local_dev.env``
   This holds *secrets* and *environment-specific configuration* required
   to get services to work in a Docker-based local development environment.

   This should **NOT** be used for server environments, but you could base
   configuration for a server environment on this file.

``test.env``
   This holds configuration specific to running the tests. It has some
   configuration value overrides because the tests are "interesting".

``my.env``
   This file lets you override any environment variables set in other ENV files
   as well as set variables that are specific to your instance.

   It is your personal file for your specific development environment--it
   doesn't get checked into version control.

   The template for this is in ``docker/config/my.env.dist``.

In this way:

1. environmental configuration which covers secrets, hosts, ports, and
   infrastructure-specific things can be set up for every environment

2. behavioral configuration which covers how the code behaves and which classes
   it uses is versioned alongside the code making it easy to deploy and revert
   behavioral changes with the code depending on them

3. ``my.env`` lets you set configuration specific to your development
   environment as well as override any configuration and is not checked into
   version control


.. seealso::

   See :ref:`config` for configuration settings.


Setting configuration specific to your local dev environment
------------------------------------------------------------

There are some variables you need to set that are specific to your local dev
environment. Put them in ``my.env``.


Overriding configuration
------------------------

If you want to override configuration temporarily for your local development
environment, put it in ``my.env``.


.. _localdev-alembic:

Alembic and Database Migrations
===============================

Ichnaea uses Alembic.

To create a new database migration, do this::

    $ make shell
    app@blahblahblah:/app$ alembic revision -m "SHORT DESCRIPTION"

Then you can edit the file.


.. _localdev-staticassets:

Building Static Assets (CSS/JS)
===============================

To recreate the node container, applying changes in ``package.json``::

    $ docker-compose build node

or both node and app containers::

    # make build

To rebuild asset files from scratch::

    $ make clean-assets buildcss buildjs

To build changed CSS files::

    $ make buildcss

To build changed JS files::

    $ make buildjs

.. _localdev-testing:

Running Tests
=============

You can run the test suite like this::

    $ make test


If you want to pass different arguments to pytest or specify specific
tests to run, open up a test shell first::

    $ make testshell
    app@blahblahblah:/app$ pytest [ARGS]


.. _localdev-docs:

Building Docs
=============

You can build the docs like this::

    $ make docs

This will create an application container with a volume mount to the
local ``docs/build/html`` directory and update the documentation so
it is available in that local directory.

To view the documentation open ``file://docs/build/html/index.html``
with a web brower.

Updating Test GeoIP Data and Libraries
======================================
The development environment uses a test MaxMind GeoIP database, and the Ichnaea
test suite will fail if this is more than 1000 days old. To update this
database and confirm tests pass, run::

    $ make update-vendored test

Commit the refreshed files.

This command can also be used to updated ``libmaxmindb`` and the ``datamaps``
source. Update ``docker.make`` for the desired versions, and run::

    $ make update-vendored build test

Commit the updated source tarballs.
